# Orthopedic-Healthcare-Dashboard-Project
I'm excited to share my latest data visualization project: an interactive Orthopedic Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel! 📊
🔍 Project Overview
## The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize patient-level orthopedic data to uncover trends, monitor KPIs, and provide actionable insights for improving patient care and satisfaction.

## 🧠 What I Did:
✔ Cleaned and structured raw patient data (dates, demographics, wait times, referral sources, satisfaction scores)
✔ Created custom KPIs to measure:

Average wait time

Patient satisfaction

Referral effectiveness

Demographic distributions
## ✔ Built interactive charts & dashboards including:

Patient visit trends 📅

Wait time analysis ⏳

CSAT score patterns 😊

Age, gender, and race breakdowns
## ✔ Identified insights like:

Longer wait times correlate with lower satisfaction

Certain age groups experience higher wait times

Referral departments affect visit load

## 🛠 Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (Power Query + Charts)

Pivot Tables

Conditional Formatting

Data Cleaning Functions

## 📌 Key Takeaways:
✅ Data visualization helps uncover real-world patterns
✅ Even Excel can be a powerful BI tool when used right
✅ Dashboards can help healthcare teams make data-driven decisions
